CPTS 471 - Computational Genomics

Project 1: Pairwise Sequence Alignment
- Implements Needleman-Wunsch global alignment and Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithms to align two biological sequences
- Accepts input sequences in FASTA format and scoring parameters via config file
- Generates optimal pairwise alignment matrix and traces back highest score path
- Produces sequence alignments indicating matches, mismatches and gaps
- Calculates alignment statistics including score, identities, gaps and percent identity
= Formats and prints aligned sequences and stats for analysis
- Identifies conserved regions and evolutionary relationships between sequence pairs
= Provides core functionality for determining functional and evolutionary similarities between DNA or protein sequences


Programming Project #2: Suffix tree construction

Programming Project #3: Genome-scale comparisons for Covid strains
